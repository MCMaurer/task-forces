## Task Force Charter: Instructor Feedback Taskforce

Approval date:  <br/>
Completion date: 

### Context
Occasionally, there are workshop hosts that provide constructive feedback regarding an instructor that has been placed at their workshop. The feedback provided generally reflects the instructors teaching style or not meeting expectations. This proposal will discuss recommendations for what to do with the constructive feedback we receive for a particular Carpentries instructor.

In order to address all of the concerns, it is recommended to create a Task Force to identify   next steps after receiving the feedback   for the instructor. Representatives from the  following teams would participate: 
Community Development Team
- Rationale: Some discussion has surrounded having the Instructor Development Team assist with further developing the Instructors when they receive constructive feedback
Instructor Training Team
- Rationale: The feedback provided may impact what is being taught in the Instructor Training curriculum. Alternatively, may require additional bonus modules 
Workshop Administration Team
- Rationale: The feedback always come to the WAT and understanding the next steps and proper communication channels is needed 

### Objective
The goal of this Task Force will be to identify what the next steps for the Instructor will be after receiving constructive feedback. There may be work that the above teams may have to develop/improve. From the recommendation, each of the task force members will report back to their teams and implement the proper workflow to ensure the next steps are in place. 

### Deliverables
Develop recommendations* for each Team to address negative feedback that we have received from a workshop regarding an instructor. This feedback comes in the following forms:
- Post-Workshop Survey 
- Emails to workshops@ or other 
- One-on-one meetings with workshop hosts/instructors 
*The task force will not update the corresponding workflows, but will make those recommendations, and Team Leads will work to implement the recommendations.
