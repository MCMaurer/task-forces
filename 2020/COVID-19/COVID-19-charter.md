## Task Force Charter: COVID-19 Response Task Force

Approval date:  17 March, 2020  
Task Force charter finalized: 20 March, 2020  
Task Force starts work: 23 March, 2020  
Completion date: 1 April, 2020  

### Context
With the COVID-19 pandemic limiting travel and in-person meetings, our existing systems for delivering two-day in-person workshops are no longer meeting the needs of our community. Our community members have already begun informally sharing their strategies and tips for teaching workshops online, and online instruction is likely to be the norm for some months. The key priority for our Core Team needs to be supporting our community in shifting from in-person to virtual instruction. 

### Objective
The objective of this task force is to develop a plan to pilot online instruction of The Carpentries curricula. This plan will take into account how this shift will impact each of our programs and identify who is well placed to carry out the work outlined. The Task Force will be working under a tight timeline, and we do not expect our first attempt at pivoting to fully online instruction to be perfect. Our goal is to create something that can quickly help the community start this shift, and can be iterated on over time.

### Deliverables
1. A document summarizing resources and strategies that have been shared by the community around online instruction, and other resources as the TF deems appropriate. This document should include a recommendation from the TF about how each strategy or resource is or is not useful for our pilot.
2. A project plan for implementing a pilot of online instruction of our technical workshops. This project plan should include information on how each Core Team member will be involved in this pilot, with estimates of their time contributions in hours.
3. A communications plan for launching this pilot.
